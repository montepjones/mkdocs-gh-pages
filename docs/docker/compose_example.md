Setting up the environment based on those guidelines requires a properly defined `docker-compose.yml` file. Below is an example of how you can structure it:

```yaml
services:
  webserver:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: httpd
    ports:
      - "3003:80"
    volumes:
      - "/opt/finance:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs"
```

### Steps to implement

1. **Create the Docker Compose file:**  
   - Navigate to the `/opt/docker/` directory:

     ```bash
     cd /opt/docker/
     ```

   - Create the `docker-compose.yml` file using a text editor like `nano`:

     ```bash
     nano docker-compose.yml
     ```

   - Paste the YAML configuration and save the file.

2. **Deploy the container:**  
   - Run the following command to start the container:

     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```

3. **Verify the deployment:**  
   - Check if the container is running:

     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

   - Ensure the port mapping is correct:

     ```bash
     docker-compose config
     ```

   - Test accessibility by navigating to `http://<docker_host_ip>:3003` in a browser.
