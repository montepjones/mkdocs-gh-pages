ðŸ”¥ This playbook ensures:
- `httpd` and `php` are installed from default YUM repos
- The new document root is created and configured properly in `httpd.conf`
- Your `phpinfo.php.j2` template is deployed with correct permissions
- Apache service is started and enabled to persist across reboots

Run it from the `~/playbooks` directory:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory httpd.yml
```
