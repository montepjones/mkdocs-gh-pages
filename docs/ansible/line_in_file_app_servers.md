This playbook:
- Installs and enables the `httpd` service
- Uses the `copy` module to ensure the initial file content
- Prepends the welcome line using `lineinfile` and keeps ownership/permissions consistent

Once the inventory is in place, you're good to launch this with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```
